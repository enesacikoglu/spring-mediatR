# Spring MediatR

An implementation of [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) on the JVM for the Spring Framework. This project is heavily inspired by
the [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) project for .NET by Jimmy Bogard. Many of the concepts
from [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) have been incorporated in this project.

Spring MediatR is a simply library with the goal of helping de-couple components, avoid 
fat services/controllers, and reduce the need to inject excessive dependencies. Spring MediatR 
is meant to be light and simple.

## Basics

Spring MediatR has two kinds of messages it dispatches:

* Request - Dispatches to a single handler, can return value
* Event - Dispatches to one or many handlers, does not provide a mechanism to return value

### Request and RequestHandler

### Event and EventHandler
